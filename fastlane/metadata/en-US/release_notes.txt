This patch fixes an annoying image glitch and brings better video playback. It might be the best version so far.

Correct aspect ratio of Search Result and Queue images.

Improved video playback integration, animating the mini-player when skipping between audio and video, and allowing seemless remote controlled skipping from video to video, for example, with Now Playing on Apple Watch.

No more flickering of the play button in the mini-player at the bottom.
