This version, the first using a new simplified version number, provides more information about Podest in the Settings app, namely version, subscription, and expiration date for free trials. On iPad, episode images are displayed in the correct size. Large titles are refrained. And while it’s springtime round these parts, it’s time for new icon colors.

From now on versions will be counted in whole numbers, eight, nine, 10, etc., with a relative build number, for example, 8 (2) for version eight, build two. Patches are going to be counted after a dot, 8.1, say. Full-on Semantic Versioning didn’t prove itself practical for this app.

Thanks to ABI stability, app size is down to five megabytes. Good job, Swift team.
