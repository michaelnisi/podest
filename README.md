Podest is a podcast player app for iOS making podcasts simple. Iâ€™ve written about my motivation [here](https://troubled.pro/2018/10/podest.html). Download the app on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364) and leave a rating or review to support this project.

## Development

### Install

To setup for development, cloning repos of dependencies to `../`, do.

```
./tools/setup
```

Some private app configuration must be generated. Check the script to see the variables it expects.

```
./tools/configure
```

Setup a local Xcode workspace with the app and all dependencies.
