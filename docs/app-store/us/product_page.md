PRAGMATIC QUEUE

Automatic updates only keep the latest episode of a podcast in your queue. This prevents cluttering over time. Episodes that have been added by you are not removed automatically. Also played episodes are kept in the queue, giving you a chance to relisten. Remove an episode to dismiss it or simply wait until it’s replaced by an update.
